# AI_NOTES.md

## 1. Context

This project (`nxp_simtemp`) implements a simulated temperature sensor as a Linux kernel module with sysfs and userspace interfaces.  
AI assistance (ChatGPT / GPT-5) was used during the development process to accelerate documentation and testing steps, not to generate critical kernel code directly.

---

## 2. Prompts Used

AI was prompted to:
- Explain typical Linux kernel module structure and `file_operations`.
- Suggest a clean `DESIGN.md` layout (block diagram, data flow, and API interactions).
- Draft a `TESTPLAN.md` with relevant validation steps for the simulated temperature driver.

---

## 3. AI-Generated Content

The following files or sections were written with AI assistance:
- `DESIGN.md` — initial structure and descriptive text (architecture, API, locking model, DT mapping).
- `TESTPLAN.md` — test descriptions, expected results, and summary table.

All kernel-level code (`nxp_simtemp.c`) was **written and validated manually** by the author.  
The AI suggestions were reviewed for correctness and adjusted for the real implementation.

---

## 4. Validation of AI Outputs

- **Technical review:** All AI-generated documentation was compared against the actual source code to ensure consistency (variable names, sysfs attributes, etc.).
- **Functional testing:** Every test described in `TESTPLAN.md` was executed on the target VM, and results were updated manually based on observed behavior.
- **Ethical compliance:** No proprietary or license-restricted code was requested or copied from the AI system.

---

## 5. Notes

AI assistance was used strictly as a **writing and explanation tool**.  
All source code, debugging, and final validation were performed by the developer (Jesús García Barrera).
